Task 12 – Data Transformation using Power Query

Dataset Used: HR Analytics Dataset

Transformations Performed:

1. Removed unnecessary columns:
   - EmployeeCount
   - EmployeeNumber
   - Over18
   - StandardHours

2. Corrected Data Types:
   - Numeric columns converted to Whole Number.
   - Attrition converted to Text.
   - MonthlyIncome set to Whole Number.

3. Created Conditional Columns:
   - Age Group:
        Young (<=25)
        Mid Age (26–40)
        Senior (>40)

   - Attrition Flag:
        Yes = 1
        No = 0

   - Salary Band:
        Low Salary (<=4000)
        Medium Salary (<=8000)
        High Salary (>8000)

4. Created Measures:
   - Total Employees (Count of Age)
   - Employees Left (Sum of Attrition Flag)
   - Attrition Rate = Employees Left / Total Employees
   - Average Salary (Average of MonthlyIncome)

5. Built Dashboard with:
   - KPI Cards
   - Attrition by Department
   - Attrition by Age Group
   - Slicers for Department, Gender, Age Group

Final Outcome:
Interactive HR Attrition Dashboard with proper data transformation.
